The file MyIniTopo.txt is an example of 3D initial state/condition topography to load into ASPECT.
THe file has the same format than the example test topography, this is:

x. y.  z.

x, y or z are the right-side floating numbers digits, . is the floating point, and there are no digits on the right side of the point.
There is a single spacing between x and y, and a double one between y and z.

cheers,
